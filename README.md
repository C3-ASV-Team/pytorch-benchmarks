# NERSC PyTorch examples

This repository contains some PyTorch example models and training code
with support for distributed training on NERSC systems.

The layout of this package can also serve as a template for PyTorch
projects and the provided BaseTrainer and main.py script can be used to
reduce boiler plate.
